# Event manager.

A script that takes a csv file with data about people and outputs a unique form letter for each of them with their name and the names of their congressmen. The information of congressmen is obtained from Sunlight Foundation's API, and matched to the people based on zip code. This was created by following the [tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html) from Jumpstart Labs as part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/file-i-o-and-serialization).
